 WEEK 05 FEWD-DC-21 FINAL PROJECT [PROPOSED PLAN]
 BY DANNY YI 02/28/2016 REVISION 00

Create a website about a fictitious product with a strong emphasis on brand identity and story. The layout of the website should be in a format where it can show and tell the visitor of a story about the brand before presenting the product(s) or possible purchasing options. The layout and menu links/buttons should be simple, straightforward, and engaging for the visitor. One of my goals of this project is to build a strong brand presence through consistency and organization with the foundations learned from FEWD at GA and my design experience with former corporate brands.
